### 1. Recipe of the Day  
Each time the page is refreshed, Eatlyst randomly selects and displays a recipe from a large database of web-scraped recipes. This makes discovering new dishes effortless and fun.  

### 2. Suggest a Food  
Users can input their preferred ranges for carbohydrates, protein, fats, and calories. Based on these parameters, Eatlyst filters and presents foods that fit within the selected nutritional criteria.
